# IoT Weather Monitoring System

This project is an IoT-based weather monitoring system that utilizes NodeMCU, a rain sensor, a barometric sensor, DHT11, and the Blynk IoT app interface to visualize results. The system transmits data through the internet for real-time monitoring of weather conditions.

## Components Used
- NodeMCU
- Rain sensor
- Barometric sensor
- DHT11
- Blynk IoT app

## Features
- Collects real-time data on temperature, humidity, air pressure, and rainfall.
- Transmits data over the internet for remote monitoring.
- Visualizes weather data using the Blynk IoT app interface.

## Setup Instructions
1. Connect the NodeMCU to the sensors as per the circuit diagram.
2. Install the necessary libraries for NodeMCU, DHT11, and Blynk.
3. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the NodeMCU board.
4. Configure the Blynk app to receive and display the weather data.
5. Power on the system and monitor weather conditions remotely using the Blynk app.
